# Polynomial Regression: An Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting 
a polynomial equation to the observed data. In this method, the regression equation is a polynomial function of the independent variable(s). 
The degree of the polynomial equation depends on the number of independent variables and the complexity of the relationship between the dependent and 
independent variables.

### General Equation
The general equation for polynomial regression is given by:

**$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \beta_3 x^3 + ... + \beta_n x^n + \epsilon$**

Here, y is the _dependent variable_, x is the _independent variable_, $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, ... \beta_n$ are the_ coefficients_ of the polynomial equation, n is the degree of the polynomial equation and $\epsilon$ is the error term.

### Advantages
Polynomial regression has several advantages over other types of regression analysis. For example, it can capture the non-linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, which other regression models such as linear regression cannot. Additionally, polynomial regression is relatively simple to implement and interpret.

### Applications
Polynomial regression has a wide range of applications in various fields, including finance, economics, engineering, and physics. 
It can be used to model complex systems, such as stock market trends, economic growth rates, and climate change patterns.

### Conclusion
Polynomial regression is a powerful tool for modeling non-linear relationships between dependent and independent variables. 
It has several advantages over other regression models and can be applied to a wide range of real-world problems.
