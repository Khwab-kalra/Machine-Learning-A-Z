# Multilinear Regression
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Multilinear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable. In other words, it is a technique that allows us to predict the value of a dependent variable based on several independent variables. Multilinear regression is a powerful tool for data analysis and prediction, and it is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences.

To build a multilinear regression model, there are several methods that can be used, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These methods include:

### **All-in method:** 
This method involves including all independent variables in the model at once, without any selection or elimination. This approach can be useful when the number of independent variables is small, and there is strong prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Backward elimination:**
This method involves starting with a model that includes all independent variables and then iteratively removing the variable with the highest p-value until all remaining variables have a p-value below a certain threshold. This approach is useful when the number of independent variables is large, and there is little prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Forward selection:** 
This method involves starting with a model that includes only one independent variable and then iteratively adding the variable with the lowest p-value until no further variables can be added. This approach is useful when the number of independent variables is large, and there is little prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Bidirectional elimination:** 
This method combines both backward elimination and forward selection. It starts with a model that includes all independent variables, removes the variable with the highest p-value, and then adds the variable with the lowest p-value until no further variables can be added or removed. This approach is useful when the number of independent variables is moderate, and there is some prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Score comparison:** 
This method involves comparing different models based on a certain score, such as the _Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)_ or _the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)_. The model with the lowest score is selected as the best model. This approach is useful when there are multiple possible models with different combinations of independent variables.

In conclusion, multilinear regression is a powerful tool for data analysis and prediction, and there are several methods for building models that can be used depending on the number of independent variables and the amount of prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables. It is important to choose the appropriate method for each situation to ensure accurate and reliable results.

The general form of a multilinear regression equation is:

#### ****y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βnxn + ε****

Where:

y is the _dependent variable_ that we are trying to predict
β0 is the _intercept or constant term_
β1, β2, ..., βn are the _regression coefficients or slopes_ that represent the relationship between each independent variable (x1, x2, ..., xn) and the dependent variable y
ε is the _error term or residual_ that represents the difference between the predicted value and the actual value of the dependent variable.

The equation can be extended to include polynomial terms by adding additional terms to the equation. For example, a second-order polynomial equation with two independent variables x1 and x2 can be expressed as:

#### ****y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + β3x1^2 + β4x2^2 + β5x1x2 + ε****

Where β3 and β4 represent the quadratic effect of x1 and x2, respectively, and β5 represents the interaction effect between x1 and x2.

In general, the degree of the polynomial term indicates the order of the effect on the dependent variable. For example, a third-order polynomial term x^3 represents a cubic effect on the dependent variable.

It is important to note that including higher-order polynomial terms in the regression equation can result in overfitting, which means that the model is too complex and is fit too closely to the training data, which can result in poor performance when applied to new data. Therefore, it is important to balance the complexity of the model with its predictive accuracy.
