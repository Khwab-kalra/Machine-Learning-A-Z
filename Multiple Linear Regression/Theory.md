# Multilinear Regression
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multilinear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable. In other words, it is a technique that allows us to predict the value of a dependent variable based on several independent variables. Multilinear regression is a powerful tool for data analysis and prediction, and it is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences.

To build a multilinear regression model, there are several methods that can be used, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. These methods include:

### **All-in method:** 
This method involves including all independent variables in the model at once, without any selection or elimination. This approach can be useful when the number of independent variables is small, and there is strong prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Backward elimination:**
This method involves starting with a model that includes all independent variables and then iteratively removing the variable with the highest p-value until all remaining variables have a p-value below a certain threshold. This approach is useful when the number of independent variables is large, and there is little prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Forward selection:** 
This method involves starting with a model that includes only one independent variable and then iteratively adding the variable with the lowest p-value until no further variables can be added. This approach is useful when the number of independent variables is large, and there is little prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Bidirectional elimination:** 
This method combines both backward elimination and forward selection. It starts with a model that includes all independent variables, removes the variable with the highest p-value, and then adds the variable with the lowest p-value until no further variables can be added or removed. This approach is useful when the number of independent variables is moderate, and there is some prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables.

### **Score comparison:** 
This method involves comparing different models based on a certain score, such as the _Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)_ or _the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)_. The model with the lowest score is selected as the best model. This approach is useful when there are multiple possible models with different combinations of independent variables.

In conclusion, multilinear regression is a powerful tool for data analysis and prediction, and there are several methods for building models that can be used depending on the number of independent variables and the amount of prior knowledge about the relationship between the variables. It is important to choose the appropriate method for each situation to ensure accurate and reliable results.
